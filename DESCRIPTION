Description: Leveraging (large) language models for automatic topic labeling. The main function converts a list of top terms into a label for each topic. Hence, it is complementary to any topic modeling package that produces a list of top terms for each topic. While human judgement is indispensable for topic validation (i.e., inspecting top terms and most representative documents), automatic topic labeling can be a valuable tool for researchers in various scenarios.
